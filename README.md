# IoT-Based-Smart-Pots

### Introduction

Plants add beauty to the environment and purify the air, enhancing the quality of life. But many times, we forget to take care of our plants due to our busy lifestyles or due to frequent trips. The Smart Flower Pot device helps us to communicate with our plants. This device can collect data about the moisture of the soil, light intensity, temperature and humidity of the air with the help of sensors, then display the results on the LCD display. It enables us to upload data to network with the help of a wireless communication module. The data will be available online and can be viewed anytime and anywhere.
This system alarms the user about soil moisture through LED along with measuring outside temperature and humidity. This tool can automatically provide water to the soil with a vinyl tube attached to the water pump whenever the soil moisture is low by making the modification to the potentiometer to control the threshold of soil humidity.
